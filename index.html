            <h3>Beetlejuice on Broadway and at MSU</h3>

            <p>It was Monday October 10th around 7:00 pm when my anxiety turned into excitement. I was talking on the phone with my great friend, Nolan, and 
                I was contemplating why famous artists went to his school to perform, but not at MSU. I decided to look up <strong>"Michigan State University Concerts"</strong>
                and began to scroll through the listing on the Wharton Center website. Scrolling and scrolling, yet I saw nothing that struck my eye... then I saw it.
                Beetlejuice on Broadway was coming to Michigan State University in March 2023! I was <strong>ecstatic!</strong> Believe it or not, I went on a trip to New York with my dad and sister
                in August and we saw Beetlejuice on Broadway! I was <strong>obsessed</strong> and I wanted to see it again. This <strong>once in a life opportunity</strong> presented itself in front of me for 
                a second time, but with discount and convenience. I screamed with excitement over the phone to my friend and texted people who might want to see the show with me. It only took me a horrible
                half an hour to set up my MSU login with the Wharton Center to get student price tickets, but every second of stress to get the best seat possible was worth it. I cannot wait to see the Beetlejuice cast 
                on stage once again; I know it will be just as <strong>shocking</strong> seeing it a second time!

            <h3>Balletcore and the Rise of Heaven by Marc Jacobs</h3>
            <address class="author"><a rel="author" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylor-lenz-458aa221b/">Taylor Lenz</a></address>
            <time datetime="2022-10-10" title="October 10, 2022">Oct 10, 2022</time>
            <p>Once again, social media influencers and fashion icons such as Bella Hadid and Jang Wonyoung have shocked the designer world with their outrageous styles. The new fad, <strong>Balletcore</strong>,
                is exactly as it sounds: <strong>centered around Ballet</strong>. Those who partake in Balletcore will wear <strong>Miu Miu</strong> Ballet Flats or Heels with a simple pink skirt and knitted sweater.
                I personally think this trend is adorable and fashionable, however I have nowhere near enough money or confidence to wear almost $1000 flats... especially with the 
                way weather works in Michigan. I would rate this trend an <strong>8/10</strong> by subtracting 2 points for luxury pricing and the fact I know my feet would be in pain after walking around campus in flats.

                <strong>Heaven by Marc Jacobs</strong> is a new and rising section of the <strong>Marc Jacobs</strong> brand. Many influencers such as <strong>Nicki Minaj, Bladee, Pamela Anderson, Doja Cat, and many more</strong> have modeled or even had a collection for the brand.
                When I found out about this brand in the Spring of 2022, I thought it was iconic. I saw so many items I wanted, but could not see myself spending so much money. In the end, I am glad I decided to save my cash
                as I see downfall in this brand. I believe that the brand is becoming less and less successful as they are running out of ideas. A new collection came out today, October 10th 2022,
                but most of the items I saw looked like the previous releases. I hope to see more unique and stylish art pieces by <strong>Heaven by Marc Jacobs</strong> in the future, otherwise I do not think the future is bright for them.
